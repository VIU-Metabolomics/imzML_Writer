Since 1.0.0:
-Added optional scanning direction argument to writer/annotator to reflect actual dimensions when image was collected in x-scanning vs. y-scanning mode
TODO:
    -Reflect those changes in the other cvParam of the resulting imzML (top-down, etc.)

-Added blocking option to Raw_to_mzML for mac - prevents further execution so you don't need a waiting loop for compatibility in CLI
TODO:
    -Expand to PC

-Added image viewing option 'smooth', which uses scipy.nkimage's zoom option to interpolate between pixels and smooth out the square edges
-Fixed coordinate selection for spectrum viewing to match, now actually searches imzML object for matching coordinates rather than inferring by length (which broke for imzML without all data written)
-Added ROI selection tool - saves/loads ROI mask (vertices & mask) as a npy file
-Minor bug fix for compatibility with Agilent files (pymzml wants spec ID's and not indices)
