New things since review:
1. Standalone executables! - Both Mac and PC seem to be working ok, will require 2 dist for Mac (apple Silicon and intel)
TODO: Package with an official github release

2. Dynamic msconvert mapping - still tries to call msconvert from PATH, but if that fails it searches any drives/directories it can access for msconvert and calls that instead
-Save path for msconvert once found so it doesn't have to look every time

3. Python Package
-available via pip install imzML-Writer

4. Documentation - available on ReadTheDocs
-Details on using imzML_Writer from CLI

5. Functionality adjustments
-Advanced options:
    What to do with duplicated pixels
    Search tolerance for lock mass
    Zero vs. 1-indexed

6. Improved colormap configuration - GUI to add/remove colormaps to imzML_Scout, saved to a config json file in python module folder
