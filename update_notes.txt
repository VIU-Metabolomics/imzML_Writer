New things since review:
1. Standalone executables! - Both Mac and PC seem to be working ok, will require 2 dist for Mac (apple Silicon and intel)
2. Dynamic msconvert mapping - still tries to call msconvert from PATH, but if that fails it searches any drives/directories it can access for msconvert and calls that instead


TODO:
-Improve documentation throughout (ReadTheDocs page?)
-Pypi distribution for command line interface
-Save path for msconvert once found so it doesn't have to look every time
